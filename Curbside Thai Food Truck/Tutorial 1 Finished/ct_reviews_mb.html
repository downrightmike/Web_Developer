<blockquote><p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily 
improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from 
Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai. 
Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious 
and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think 
Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off 
the streets of Charlotte.</p><p><cite>Carolina Traveler</cite></p></blockquote>
      
<blockquote><p>
Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare 
and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the 
convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you 
don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast, 
Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p><p> <cite>Food Cart Review</cite></p></blockquote>
